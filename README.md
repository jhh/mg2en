# MacGourmet to Evernote

A small command-line tool to move MacGourmet recipes to Evernote by converting
between their respective export formats. The resulting Evernote export file
(*.enex) can be imported into Evernote.

This early version has a hard-code input file name in `bin/mg2en` and does not
convert all recipe attributes.

## Usage

`bundle exec bin/mg2en`
